	<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
			I spent the first 11 years of my life in Portland, OR after which I went to middle and high school in Bangalore, India. I studied Computer Science at UT Austin and I currently work at Microsoft AI and Research in Bellevue, WA.
		<br>
			The first word I ever said was 'ball' and as far as I can remember I've been in love with sports, particularly basketball. I am a long time Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks fan. I like to challenge my body in various physical feats and have fun climbing mountains when weather permits.
		<br>
			I love everything about technology but in particular I enjoy teaching machines to think using artificial intelligence. I have dedicated my life to technology but I also enjoy learning about and discussing topics including but not limited to psychology, social issues, gaming, evolutionary biology, and the list goes on.
		<br>
			I would eat Indian food everyday for the rest of my life if I could but I also enjoy Mexican and south east Asian cuisines. I'm a craft beer snob and my go to drink is scotch neat.
